What do you need?

-x1 Arduino/Genuino UNO
-x1 LCD 1602
-x1 Rotary Potentiometer
-x2 Resistor 10k ohm
-x1 Resistor 221 ohm
-x2 Pushbutton Switch 12mm
-x1 Breadboard (generic)
-x30 Jumper Wires

Let's Start

Anyone with little experience in using a breadboard, connecting wires can make this circuit easily. There is nothing to worry just follow the diagram and connect using male jumper wires or you could use the perfboard and solder everything.

Follow the circuit diagram:

First connect the LCD display, tactile switches, resistors, and potentiometer. Follow the step-by-step diagram given below if you are having trouble connecting the circuit:

Programing

Upload the code given below to your Arduino using Arduino IDE
Finish the connections with Arduino. And that's it you've built your Arduino digital clock.

Testing

Now power up the Arduino either by connecting the USB cable or by using a 12V adapter. Arduino should start and the LCD backlight should glow. Don't worry if you see nothing on the LCD. Try turning the potentiometer, you can see the text becoming clearer. Stop turning when you've achieved your desired contrast. The button on the right is for changing the hour and the one on left is for changing the minute according to the circuit diagram.
